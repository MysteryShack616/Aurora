          Based on the survey, majority of people never created their own
          websites before.
        </li>
        <li>
          The cause of this because they don’t have basics about programming at
          all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designing their own website is a hassle and requires a lot of skills
          which lots of people don't want to.

        <li>
          Majority of peoples have used WordPress.com comparing to other
          websites.
        </li>
        <li>
          WordPress are easier to use and provides many pre-design templates
          compared to other websites.

        <li>For WordPress and Wix.com, pre-design templates made available.</li>
        <li>
          However for html & CSS , users have to design their own websites to
          allow them use their creativity and freedom to design their own
          websites.

        <li>
          Most of the people agreed that it’s not too hard or too easy to edit
          their website’s content after finishing their page.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is because you have to find your content in the page (using html &
          css) which is not so easy and a bit hard to find.
        </li>
        <li>
          However, for pre-design templates (Refferring to WordPress & Wix), it
          is super easy to edit your content of your page
        </li>

          Surveys have also shown that a lot of people are unsure about the
          quality of the result because they maybe already achieve their goal
          but still have things to add.
        </li>
        <li>But there is also a group of people that is very satisfied</li>
        <li>
          There are also a very little minority of people that are dissatisfied
          with the result because their main goal cannot be achieved.
